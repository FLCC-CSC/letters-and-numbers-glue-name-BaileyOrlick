1. What is a lesson you learned during this lab? You do not have to restrict
   your response to Python. It might be a lesson in time management, a lesson
   using CodeGrade, or something else.

   In this lab, I learned that it takes practice to fully understand Python. I used a lot of trial and error understand how to output the reqiured equation from the lab.
